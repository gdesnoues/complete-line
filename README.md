## Tips

You can see a vertical line (ruler) at the final length with adding this code in your settings.json
- go to `File > Preferences > Settings > Text Editor > Files`
- clic on `Edit in settings.json`
- add this lines :
```json
    "editor.rulers": [80,120],
    "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
        "editorRuler.foreground": "#333333"
    },
```
the first line is all the rulers positions (2 in mine)

the third line is the ruler color
